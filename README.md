# Interactive-Fiction

A demonstration of how to create an interactive fiction game in Godot.

This example uses Scenes as story locations. The Scenes/Template.tscn can be duplicated to create a new location.

Connect to new locations by updating a response's Next_Scene variable in the Inspector (this should be the path to a new scene). Supports background images and automatically plays audio. A script automatically removes unused responses.
